- **Time Series Analysis**: View a time series of sales data over months.
- **Treemap**: Analyze hierarchical sales data across Region, Category, and Sub-Category.
- **Download Options**: Download various filtered data and visualizations in CSV format.
- **Scatter Plot**: Visualize the relationship between Sales, Profit, and Quantity.

### Requirements ###

To run this app, you need the following libraries:

Usage
1. Run the Streamlit App: Navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:

streamlit run dashboard.py

2. Upload Dataset: You can upload your own Superstore-like dataset in CSV format, or the app will load a default Superstore.csv dataset.

3. Interact with the Filters: Use the sidebar to filter data by Region, State, and City, and adjust the date range for analysis.
