# Sample Superstore EDA Dashboard

This is a Streamlit-powered dashboard for exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a sample Superstore dataset. The dashboard allows users to visualize and analyze sales data, apply filters, and explore various business insights in a user-friendly interface. 

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload a CSV file or use the default `Superstore.csv` dataset.
- **Date Range Filtering**: Filter data based on a date range for better analysis.
- **Sidebar Filters**: Filter by Region, State, and City.
- **Sales Visualizations**: Visualize sales by Category, Region, Segment, and more.
- **Time Series Analysis**: View a time series of sales data over months.
- **Treemap**: Analyze hierarchical sales data across Region, Category, and Sub-Category.
- **Download Options**: Download various filtered data and visualizations in CSV format.
- **Scatter Plot**: Visualize the relationship between Sales, Profit, and Quantity.

## Requirements

To run this app, you need the following libraries:

- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `plotly`
- `warnings`

Install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas plotly
Usage
Run the Streamlit App: Navigate to the directory containing the script and run the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run dashboard.py
Upload Dataset: You can upload your own Superstore-like dataset in CSV format, or the app will load a default Superstore.csv dataset.

Interact with the Filters: Use the sidebar to filter data by Region, State, and City, and adjust the date range for analysis.

View Visualizations: View various visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and time series analysis to gain insights into the sales data.

Download Data: You can download filtered datasets and visualizations directly from the app.

Troubleshooting
Missing Columns: If the dataset doesn't contain required columns like Order Date, ensure the file is in the correct format.
Empty Dataset: If the dataset appears empty after filtering, try adjusting the filters or uploading a different file.
